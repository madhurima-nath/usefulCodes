    "# Large Language Models (LLMs)\n",
    "LLMs are machine learning (ML) models designed to process and analyse text.\n",
    "They are trained on massive amounts of data. They learn the patterns\n",
    "in the language, which allows them to generate human-like responses\n",
    "to any query given to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different tasks performed by LLMs:\n",
    "- Text generation: generate text of all kinds, including\n",
    "    letters, scripts, code, poems, emails, etc.\n",
    "- Language translation: translate text from one language to another.\n",
    "- Text summarisation: summarise long pieces of text into short, concise versions.\n",
    "- Conversational agents/chatbots: interact with humans in a natural way."
